# velocity_tools
repo with a compilation of tools for velocity analysis
It includes:
-calculation of Keplerian rotation velocity map
-deprojection of relative coordinates for a given inclination and rotation angles and an arbitrary center
-calculation of velocity gradient, assuming solid velocity rotation
